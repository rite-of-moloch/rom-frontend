## Workflow:

1. Clone the repo, and create a new branch with your feature + issue number (e.g. ```1/new-cohort-button```)
2. Code!! Commit often. 
3. Create a PR to merge with ```main``` with a screenshot/recording in the description if needed. 
4. Review and approve, or review and fix suggestions.
5. Merge.
